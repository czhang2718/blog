I don’t think I know my axioms yet but here are some conjectures I’ve recently made:

Nothing matters… but you trick yourself things matter - that’s living.

Tricking works scaringly well. My mind is often my barrier to action. I am physically capable but mentally weak at times. Pretending something matters or believing in longer horizons gets me to do mundane tasks that are not worth doing if there were no longer timeline. Living is trusting that there is a future where promises are held and you are paid back.

My mind is highly malleable. I easily believe. Sometimes I’m scared the communities and activities I immerse myself in cause me to believe bad things. I’ve seen how people and values change, and that change arises from small changes over long times. I’m scared I’m treading down a negative slope. If you compared yourself on consecutive days or even months you probably cannot notice shifts. But there there must be two months where there’s a noticeable change. This has been unsettling to me; differences in my lifestyle exist but it’s hard to identify which are nontrivial and intransient. I believe this is because we don’t know what’s important until it’s changed us. Yet…

Living *is* changing. Subconscious actions are results of habits built from conscious decisions. We have total control - if and only if we believe that we have total control. We should not try control the point we are at, ie. obsess over whether we’re in the optimal time and place. We should instead strive to optimize our values and desires, maximizing our *slope* and the chance that we’ll achieve great things when the time and place align.

It’s hard because our present selves - our accomplishments, names, and character - are reflections of past ambitions. The way we are perceived now has already been determined. If the world ended today our higher ambitions would be futile. I interpret living in the present as striving for a better future.

Seize the moment, but works towards higher ones.
