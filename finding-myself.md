We're starting deep 👀

Okay so this is a topic I feel isolated, yet strongly, about. Also, this is tailored towards high schoolers.

I'm stubborn. And competitive. Success has always been a big motivator for me. In 10th grade I became uber-aware of my future and that every action (or lack thereof) could screw me over if I'm not careful. I fretted about getting into a good college. I got jealous at my peers for winning stuff-- stuff I didn't even know about. Literally people missing school to go to competitions (of any type) made me feel shitty because it was a competition I wasn't going to, and thus it, obviously, made me behind/lesser than them. I convinced myself I *had* to do [xyz] in order to [go to good college, obtain dignity, etc.]. As you can imagine, I was also the type to fear wasting time; I forced myself to stay up to 2am, on average, just so I didn't feel bad for not taking advantage of my every living second (I woke up at 6:30). 

You know that heavy, sinking feeling when you do something really embarrassing or fail miserably? I felt that constantly. I thought I was depressed. My "hustling" was mentally and physically draining. I felt shitty on a hourly basis. I remember thinking if this pain will ever end... But the only reason I can tell you this now is because I've changed, and have noticed my previous misery. 

I'm in a much better place now. Success still motivates me, but in a non-toxic way. I'm so so grateful of the time quarantine granted me. I went through a period of reflection, tied with utter confusion of why I do the things I do. By next school year, I had come to a place where I was, for once in my life, confident in my actions. I quit activities I did out of "obligation", and focused on subjects that I actually liked. I started competitive programming <3. 

And that gets me to my point: **you don't *have* to do anything**. I mean *anything*. I lived under the conviction that there were some things I just HAD to do, and there did not exist a life where I did not do it. This is false.

Our lack of mindfulness often shuts us off from *finding ourselves*. We do things for others and trick ourselves that that in turn will benefit us. For example, many of my peers would rather die than get a B. As there just cannot exist a universe where you get a B. And how many extracurriculars do you do just to impress peers/parents/admissions officers? If college got cancelled, would your tomorrow be the same?

I've been trying to conduct every action with meaning. These are some of my changes:

- I don't do homework that I'm sure won't benefit me. (Yes I've gotten Bs and no that doesn't sadden me)
- I don't confine myself to one friend group
- I stopped violin lessons after 6 years because it felt like a chore 
- I quit some coding projects, DECA, and debate; I only did them because my brother did

These past two years I've felt freer and happier as ever. I literally stopped experiencing stress. Not to mention, I've also felt the most accomplished recently. All because I no longer feel obligated to do anything in life. I mean, if my existence was a simulation and everyone else was a bot (who knows 🤷‍♀️), I want to make it out fulfilled with what I've done. 

I hope this inspires you to act with purpose, and that purpose self-selected. Now I'll fashionably end with a Kanye lyric
