# First post!

I'm typing this with great resistence. It feels weird to talk this *openly* and have my words last... forever, on the internet. I guess this is one reason I'm doing this. Hey I should just make a list of reasons. 

## Why am I doing this

1. **To connect my private thoughts to action**. lol that probably doesn't make sense. What I mean is: I, as any other creature, think privately and am confident internally. But everytime I interact with other humans it's like an alter ego of "me" is talking, not *me* me. For example, I was all giddy to start writing this first post, but once I started writing I suddenly viewed myself from the third perspective, judging the action of making a public blog that other people can read. I'm literally cringing right now too, as I write, anticipating people (you) thinking I sound haughty, or talk too much. But I feel like I shouldn't be. If someone else blogged this, I'd enjoy reading it! In short, I want to be more honest and realistic with myself.

2. **To share ideas**. Nothing technical (this is not a math blog ~~yet~~). I feel alone in many of my beliefs. I know there's so many people in this world that there's almost certainly at least someone else who can relate to my struggles, values, etc. I surely would have benefitted from being more confident in my individuality years ago. I hope sharing my thoughts can make us feel more similar than different :).

3. **To get this off my to-do list.** So I'm actually distracted now. I was solving [a problem](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=1069) (you should try it ðŸ˜€), and I took a ~~short~~ break and suddenly had the urge to write. This happens a lot... Hopefully I can get back to that problem without whimsical impulses distracting me.

In the future, I'll probably just use this as thought dump. Don't expect much. I hope I don't end up deleting this out of insecurity lol. Well now I said that, I feel like I have to hold my self accountable... 

Ok that's it good bye ðŸ’™
